This regime is governed by community of property and outlined in Article 177 and following. The spouses cannot waive either their rights or their duties under the law as a result of marriage and may not agree in a general way that their property relationships shall be governed by laws to which they are not subject or custom, but must set out in concrete terms the content of the agreements by which they intend to regulate these relationships. Marital agreements must be declared in the marriage ceremony or concluded at any time by an authentic instrument, with the consent of all the persons who were parties to the agreements, or their heirs, in order to be valid and enforceable against third parties. If the date, notary, and particulars of the contracting parties are not included in the contract, it cannot be enforced against third parties. Agreements may be amended with the consent of the parties, and homologation by the court is required for the amendment to be effective against third parties. An annotation in the margin of the marriage certificate is also necessary for any agreed amendment to be effective against third parties.'"
