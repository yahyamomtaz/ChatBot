However, if a will is discovered of which there was no knowledge at the time of acceptance, the heir is not obliged to satisfy the legacies written therein beyond the value of the inheritance, or with prejudice to the legitimate portion due to him. If the inherited properties are insufficient to satisfy such legacies, the legacies written in other wills are also reduced proportionately. If some legatees have already been satisfied in full, an action of recovery is given against them.
The burden of proving the value of the inheritance is on the heir.
 
CIVIL CODE
484
ACCEPTANCE WITH THE BENEFIT OF INVENTORY
Acceptance with the benefit of inventory is made by declaration, received by a notary or the clerk of the court in the district in which the succession was opened, and entered in the register of successions kept in the same court. 
Within one month of the entry, the declaration must be transcribed by the clerk of the court in the place where the succession was opened.
The declaration must be preceded or followed by the inventory, in the form prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure.
If the inventory is made before the declaration, the register must also mention the date on which it was made.
If the inventory is made after the declaration, the public officer who made the inventory shall, within one month, have the date on which it was made entered in the register.

CIVIL CODE
485
SUCCESSOR IN POSSESSION OF PROPERTY
The successor when in any capacity he is in possession of hereditary property, must make the inventory within three months from the day of the opening of the succession or the notice of the devolution of the estate. If within this period he has begun it but has been unable to complete it, he may obtain from the court of the place where the succession opened an extension, which, except in serious circumstances, shall not exceed three months. 
After this period has elapsed without the inventory having been completed, the successor is considered the heir pure and simple.
Once the inventory has been completed, the successor who has not yet made the declaration pursuant to ART484 has a period of forty days from the date of the completion of the inventory to deliberate whether he accepts or renounces the inheritance. After this period has elapsed without his having deliberated, he shall be considered heir pure and simple.

If he fails to appear, the court appoints a curator to represent the inheritance in court.

CIVIL CODE
487
SUCCESSOR WHO IS NOT IN POSSESSION OF PROPERTY
A successor who is not in possession of property of the inheritance can make a declaration to accept with the benefit of inventory, as long as the right to accept is not prescribed.
When he or she has made the declaration, he or she must take inventory within three months of the declaration, unless an extension is granted by the court pursuant to ART485; failing which, he or she is considered a pure and simple heir.
When he has made the inventory not preceded by a declaration of acceptance, the latter must be made within forty days after the completion of the inventory; failing which the called party loses the right to accept the estate.

CIVIL CODE
488
DECLARATION IN CASE OF TERM SET BY THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITY.
The successor who is not in possession of property of the estate, if a term is assigned to him pursuant to ART481, must, within that term, also make an inventory; if he makes the declaration and not the inventory, he is considered a heir pure and simple.
The judicial authority can grant a deferral.

CIVIL CODE 
489
INCAPACITATED
Minors, interdicts and incapacitated persons are not deemed to have forfeited the benefit of the inventory, except upon the completion of one year from the age of majority or the termination of the state of interdiction or incapacitation, if they have not complied with the rules of this section within that period.
 
CIVIL CODE
490
EFFECT OF BENEFIT OF INVENTORY
The effect of the benefit of inventory consists in keeping the estate of the deceased separate from that of the heir.
Consequently:
1) the heir retains toward the estate all the rights and all the obligations he had toward the deceased, except those which have been extinguished by death;
2) the heir is not obligated to pay the debts of the estate and bequests beyond the value of the property received by him.
3) creditors of the estate and legatees have preference over the assets of the estate before the heir's creditors. They shall not, however, be dispensed from applying for the separation of property, in accordance with the provisions of the following chapter, if they wish to retain this preference even in the event that the heir lapses or renounces the benefit of inventory.
 
CIVIL CODE
491
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE HEIR IN ADMINISTRATION
The heir with benefit of inventory  is not liable for the administration of the estate except for gross negligence.

CIVIL CODE
492
SECURITY
If creditors or others having an interest so require, the heir must give suitable security for the value of movable property included in the inventory, for the fruits of real estate, and for the price of the same that exceeds the payment of mortgage creditors.
 
CIVIL CODE
493
ALIENATION OF INHERITED PROPERTY WITHOUT AUTHORISATION
The heir forfeits the benefit of inventory if he alienates or subjects to pledge or mortgage hereditary property, or transacts with respect to such property without judicial authorization and without observing the forms prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure.
For movable property, the authorization is not necessary after five years have elapsed since the declaration of acceptance with benefit of inventory.
 
CIVIL CODE
494
OMISSIONS OR INFIDELITY IN THE INVENTORY
An heir who has omitted in bad faith to report in the inventory property belonging to the estate, or who has reported in bad faith, in the inventory itself, liabilities that do not exist, shall be forfeited from the benefit of the inventory.
 
CIVIL CODE
495
PAYMENT OF CREDITORS AND LEGATEES
After one month has elapsed from the transcription provided for in ART484 or from the annotation provided for in the same ARTfor the case that the inventory is subsequent to the declaration, the heir, when creditors or legatees do not object and he does not intend to promote the liquidation in accordance with ART503, pays creditors and legatees to the extent that they arise, without prejudice to their potiority rights.
Having exhausted the estate, creditors who remain unsatisfied have only the right of recourse against legatees, even if of a specific thing belonging to the testator, to the extent of the value of the legacy.
This right is time-barred in three years from the day of the last payment unless the claim is previously time-barred.
 
CIVIL CODE
496
RETURN ON ACCOUNT
The heir is obligated to render an account of his administration to creditors and legatees, who may have a term assigned to the heir.

CIVIL CODE
497
DELAY IN RENDERING THE ACCOUNT
The heir can not be compelled to pay with his own property, except when he has been constituted in default to present the account and has not yet fulfilled this obligation.
After the liquidation of the account, he can not be compelled to pay with his own property except to the extent of the sums he owes.
 
CIVIL CODE 
498
LIQUIDATION OF THE INHERITANCE IN CASE OF OPPOSITION
If within the time limit specified in ART495 he has been notified of opposition by creditors or legatees, the heir can not make payments, but must settle the estate in the interest of all creditors and legatees.
For this purpose he must, not later than one month from the service of the opposition, by means of a notary in the place of the open succession, invite creditors and legatees to submit, within a time limit set by the notary and not less than thirty days, statements of claim.
The invitation is sent by registered mail to the creditors and legatees whose domicile or residence is known and is published in the legal notice sheet of the province.

CIVIL CODE
499
LIQUIDATION PROCEDURE
Once the term within which statements of claim must be filed has expired, the heir  with the assistance of the notary public, liquidates the inherited assets by having the necessary alienations authorized. If the alienation relates to property subject to a lien or mortgage, the liens are not extinguished, and the mortgages are not cancelled until the purchaser deposits the price in the manner determined by the court or pays the creditors placed in the state of graduation provided for in the following paragraph.
The heir forms, again with the assistance of the notary, the state of graduation. Creditors  are ranked according to their respective rights of pre-emption. They are preferred to legatees. Among creditors not entitled to preemption, the inherited assets are distributed in proportion to their respective claims.
If, in order to satisfy the creditors, it is necessary to include in the liquidation also the object of a legatee of specie, on the sum remaining after the payment of the creditors the legatee of specie is preferred over the other legatees.
 
CIVIL CODE
500
TERM FOR LIQUIDATION
The judicial authority, on the request of any of the creditors or legatees, may assign a term to the heir to liquidate the inherited assets and to form the state of graduation.
 
CIVIL CODE
501
CLAIMS
Upon completion of the state of graduation, the notary gives notice by registered mail to the creditors and legatees whose domicile or residence is known, and arranges for the publication of an extract of the state in the province's legal notice sheet. (1) After thirty days have elapsed without complaint from the date of this publication, the state of graduation becomes final.
 
CIVIL CODE
502
PAYMENT OF CREDITORS AND LEGATEES
Once the graduation status has become final or the judgment ruling on the claims has become final, the heir  satisfies creditors and legatees in accordance with the same status. This constitutes an enforceable title against the heir.
The placement of conditional claims does not prevent the payment of later creditors, provided they give security.
Creditors and legatees who have not appeared have an action against the heir only to the extent of the amount remaining after payment of creditors and legatees placed in the state of graduation. This action prescribes in three years from the day on which the status became final or the judgment pronouncing on the claims became final, unless the claim is previously prescribed.
 
CIVIL CODE
503
LIQUIDATION INITIATED BY THE HEIR.
Even when there is no opposition by creditors or legatees, the heir may make use of the liquidation procedure provided for in the preceding articles.
Payment made to preferential or mortgage creditors does not prevent the heir from availing himself of this procedure.

CIVIL CODE
504
LIQUIDATION IN CASE OF MULTIPLE HEIRS
If there is more than one heir with the benefit of inventory, each can promote the liquidation; but he must invite his co-heirs before the notary within the term that the notary has established for the declaration of claims. Coheirs who do not appear are represented in the liquidation by the notary public.

CIVIL CODE
505
FORFEITURE OF BENEFIT
The heir, who, in case of opposition, does not observe the rules established in ART498 or does not complete the liquidation or graduation status within the term established in ART500, forfeits the benefit of inventory.
Similarly, an heir who, in the case provided for in ART503, after the invitation to creditors to submit statements of claim, makes payments before the liquidation procedure is finalized or fails to observe the time limit set for him under ART500 forfeits the benefit of inventory.
Forfeiture does not occur when it concerns payments to preferential or mortgage creditors.
In any case, forfeiture of the benefit of inventory can be asserted only by the deceased's creditors and legatees.

CIVIL CODE 
506
INDIVIDUAL PROCEDURES
After the publication prescribed in the third paragraph of ART498 has been carried out, no enforcement procedures may be instituted at the instance of creditors. However, those in progress can be continued, but the part of the price remaining after the payment of preferential and mortgage creditors must be distributed according to the graduation status provided for in ART499.
Time-bound claims become due. The benefit of the time limit remains, however, when the claim is secured by collateral on assets the alienation of which is not necessary for the purposes of liquidation, and the collateral is capable of ensuring the full satisfaction of the claim.
From the date of publication of the invitation to creditors provided for in Art. 498(3) the running of interest on unsecured claims is suspended. The creditors are however entitled, after the liquidation has been completed, to the payment of interest on any residual amount.

CIVIL CODE
507
RELEASE OF PROPERTY TO CREDITORS AND LEGATEES
The heir, not later than one month after the expiration of the time limit set for submitting statements of claim, if he has not carried out any act of liquidation, may release all the property of the estate for the benefit of creditors and legatees.
For this purpose, the heir must, in the forms specified in ART498, give notice to creditors and legatees whose domicile or residence is known; he must enter the declaration of release in the register of inheritances, record it, in the margin of the transcript prescribed in the second paragraph of ART484, and transcribe it in the offices of the land registers of the places where the hereditary property is located and in the offices where movable property is registered.
From the time the declaration of release is transcribed, acts of disposition of the hereditary property performed by the heir are without effect with respect to creditors and legatees.
The heir must deliver the property to the liquidator appointed in accordance with the rules of the following article. Upon delivery, he is released from all liability for the debts of the estate.
 
CIVIL CODE
508
APPOINTMENT OF THE LIQUIDATOR
Once the declaration of release has been transcribed, the court of the place where the succession was open, at the request of the heir or one of the creditors or legatees, or even ex officio, appoints a liquidator so that he or she may provide for the liquidation in accordance with the rules of Articles 498 et seq.
The decree appointing the liquidator is entered in the register of successions.
The assets remaining, after the expenses of the liquidator have been paid and the creditors and legatees placed in the state of graduation have been satisfied, accrue to the heir, subject to the action of the creditors and legatees, who have not appeared, within the limits determined by the third paragraph of ART502.
 
CIVIL CODE
509
LIQUIDATION CONTINUED AT THE INSTANCE OF CREDITORS OR LEGATEES.
If, after the expiration of the time limit set for submitting statements of claim, the heir incurs the forfeiture of the benefit of inventory, but none of the creditors or legatees asserts it, the court of the place of the open succession, upon the petition of one of the creditors or legatees, after hearing the heir and those who have submitted statements of claim, appoints a liquidator with the task of providing for the liquidation of the estate in accordance with the rules of Articles 499 et seq. After the liquidator has been appointed, forfeiture of the benefit can no longer be enforced.
The decree appointing the liquidator is entered in the register of inheritances, noted in the margin of the transcript prescribed by the second paragraph of ART484, and transcribed in the offices of the land registers of the places where the hereditary property is located and in the offices where movable property is registered.
The heir loses the administration of the property and is obliged to hand it over to the administrator. The acts of disposition that the heir makes after transcribing the decree appointing the liquidator are without effect with respect to creditors and legatees.
 
CIVIL CODE
510
ACCEPTANCE OR INVENTORY MADE BY ONE OF THE SUCCESSORS
An acceptance with benefit of inventory made by one of the successors benefits all the others, even if the inventory is made by a called one other than the one who made the declaration.
 
CIVIL CODE
511
EXPENSES
The expenses of sealing, inventory and any other act dependent on acceptance with benefit of inventory are borne by the inheritance.
 
CIVIL CODE
512
OBJECT OF SEPARATION
The separation of the deceased's property from that of the heir ensures the satisfaction, with the deceased's property, of his creditors and legatees who have exercised it in preference to the heir's creditors.
The right to separation also accrues to creditors or legatees who have other security over the deceased's property.
Separation does not prevent creditors and legatees who have exercised it from also being satisfied on the heir's own property.

CIVIL CODE
513
SEPARATION AGAINST LEGATEES OF SPECIES
Creditors of the deceased can exercise separation also with respect to property that is the subject of legatees of specie.
 
CIVIL CODE
514
RELATIONS BETWEEN SEPARATING AND NON-SEPARATING CREDITORS
Creditors and legatees who have exercised separation have the right to be satisfied on the separated property in preference to creditors and legatees who have not exercised it, when the value of the non-separated portion of the estate would have been sufficient to satisfy the non-separated creditors and legatees.
Outside this case, non-separating creditors and legatees may compete with those who have exercised separation; but, if part of the estate has not been separated the value of this is added to the price of the separated property to determine how much would be due to each of the competitors, and is then considered to have been attributed in full to the non-separating creditors and legatees.
When separation is exercised by creditors and legatees, creditors are preferred over legatees. Preference is also given, in the case provided for in the preceding paragraph, to non-separating creditors before separating legatees.
In all cases, causes of preemption remain unaffected.
 
CIVIL CODE
515
TERMINATION OF SEPARATION.
The heir can prevent or cause the separation to cease by paying creditors and legatees, and giving security for the payment of those whose right is suspended by condition or subject to term or is disputed.

CIVIL CODE 
516
TERM FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT OF SEPARATION
The right to separation must be exercised within the period of three months from the opening of the succession.
 
CIVIL CODE
517
SEPARATION CONCERNING MOVABLE RIGHTS.
The right to separation with respect to furniture is exercised by court application.
The application is made by petition to the court of the place of the open succession, which orders an inventory, if it has not yet been made, and makes the necessary provisions for the preservation of the same.
With respect to furniture already alienated by the heir, the right to separation  includes only the price not yet paid.
 
CIVIL CODE
518
SEPARATION CONCERNING REAL PROPERTY
With respect to real property and other property capable of being mortgaged, the right to separation is exercised by the registration of the claim or legacy over each of the same property. The inscription is made in the manner established for inscribing mortgages, stating the name of the deceased and that of the heir, if known, and stating that the inscription itself is taken by way of separation of property. The title need not be produced for such an inscription.
Entries by way of separation, even if made at different times, all take the rank of the first and prevail over transcripts and entries against the heir or legatee, even if earlier.
The rules on mortgages apply to inscriptions by way of separation.

CIVIL CODE
519
DECLARATION OF WAIVER
Waiver of inheritance is made by declaration, received by a notary  or the clerk of the court of the district (1) in which the succession was opened, and entered in the register of inheritances.
A waiver made gratuitously in favor of all those to whom the waiverer's share would have devolved does not take effect until, by any of the parties, the forms specified in the preceding paragraph are observed.
 
CIVIL CODE
520
CONDITIONAL, TERM OR PARTIAL WAIVER
A waiver made under condition or term or only in part is void.
 
CIVIL CODE
521
RETROACTIVITY OF THE WAIVER
A person who renounces the inheritance is considered as if he had never been called to it.
However, the renouncer may retain the donation or claim the legacy made to him up to the amount of the available portion, subject to the provisions of Articles 551 and 552.

CIVIL CODE 
522
DEVOLUTION IN LEGITIMATE SUCCESSIONS.
In legitimate successions, the portion of one who renounces accrues to those who would have concurred with the renouncer, subject to the right of representation and subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of ART571. If the renouncer is alone, the inheritance devolves to those to whom it would devolve in the event that he were absent.

CIVIL CODE 
523
DEVOLUTION IN TESTAMENTARY SUCCESSIONS.
In testamentary successions, if the testator has not provided for a substitution and if the right of representation does not take place, the renouncer's share accrues to the co-heirs in accordance with ART674, or devolves to the legal heirs in accordance with ART677.

CIVIL CODE 
524
APPEAL OF WAIVER BY CREDITORS.
If any person waives, albeit without fraud, an inheritance to the detriment of his creditors, the creditors may have themselves authorized to accept the inheritance in the name and place of the renouncer, for the sole purpose of satisfying themselves on the inherited property to the extent of their claims.
The right of creditors prescribes in five years from the date of renunciation.

CIVIL CODE 
525
REVOCATION OF WAIVER
As long as the right to accept the inheritance is not prescribed against those called who have renounced it, they can always accept it, if it has not already been acquired by another of the called parties, without prejudice to the claims acquired by third parties over the property of the estate.

CIVIL CODE 
526
APPEAL ON THE GROUND OF VIOLENCE OR FRAUD
A waiver of inheritance can be challenged only if it is the effect of violence or fraud.
The action prescribes in five years from the day on which the violence ceased or the fraud was discovered.

CIVIL CODE 
527
MISAPPROPRIATION OF HEREDITARY ASSETS 
The successor who have subtracted or concealed property pertaining to the inheritance forfeit the right to renounce it and are considered pure and simple heirs notwithstanding their renunciation.
 
CIVIL CODE 
528
APPOINTMENT OF THE ADMINISTRATOR
When the person called has not accepted the inheritance and is not in possession of any property of the estate, the court of the district in which the succession was opened, upon the application of the persons concerned or even ex officio, has to appoint an administrator.
The decree appointing the curator, by the clerk, is published as an extract in the province's legal notice sheet and entered in the register of inheritances.

CIVIL CODE 
529
DUTIES OF THE ADMINISTRATOR
The administrator is obliged to take an inventory of the estate, exercise and promote its claims, respond to petitions brought against it, administer it, deposit with the post office cashiers or with a credit institution designated by the court the money that is in the estate or is withdrawn from the sale of furniture or real estate, and, lastly, account for its administration.

CIVIL CODE 
530
PAYMENT OF INHERITANCE DEBTS 
The administrator provides for the payment of the debts of the inheritance and legacies, subject to the authorization of the court. 
If, however, any of the creditors or legatees opposes, the curator cannot make any payment, but must provide for the liquidation of the inheritance in accordance with the rules of Articles 498 et seq.

CIVIL CODE 
531

CIVIL CODE
534
RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES
The heir can also take action against successors in title from those who possess as heirs or without title.
The rights acquired, as a result of agreements for consideration with the heir apparent, by third parties who prove that they bargained in good faith are not affected.
The provision of the preceding paragraph does not apply to real property and movable property entered in public registers, if the purchase by title of heir and the purchase from the heir apparent have not been transcribed prior to the transcription of the purchase by the heir or the true legatee, or the transcription of the court application against the heir apparent.

EGACY IN EXCESS OF THE DISPOSABLE PORTION
When the testator disposes of a usufruct or life annuity whose income exceeds that of the disposable portion, the legitimates, who have been assigned the bare ownership of the disposable portion or part of it, have the choice either to execute this disposition or to relinquish the bare ownership of the disposable portion. In the latter case, the legatee, by achieving the abandoned disposable, does not acquire the status of heir.
The legitimates have the same choice when the testator has disposed of the bare ownership of a portion in excess of the available portion.
If there are more legitimates, the agreement of all is required for the testamentary disposition to be executed.
The same rules also apply if of the usufruct, annuity or bare property was disposed of by gift.
 
CIVIL CODE
551
LEGACIES IN LIEU OF LEGITIMACY
If a legatee is left a legacy in lieu of the legitimacy he can waiver the legacy and claim the legitimacy.
If he prefers to attain the legacy, he loses the right to ask for a supplement, in case the value of the legacy is less than that of the legitimacy, and he does not acquire the quality of heir. This provision does not apply when the testator has expressly granted the legatee, the right to request the supplement.
The legacy in lieu of the legitimacy is borne by the unavailable portion. If, however, the value of the legacy exceeds that of the legitimacy due to the legitimary, for the excess the legacy is borne by the available portion.

REDUCTION OF THE PORTIONS OF LEGITIMATE HEIRS IN CONCURRENCE WITH LEGITIMARIES
When on the property left by the deceased all or part of the legitimate succession is opened, in the concurrence of legitimates with other successors, the portions that would be due to the latter are reduced proportionately to the extent necessary to supplement the share reserved for the legitimates, who, however, must impute to this, pursuant to ART564, what they have received from the deceased by virtue of donations or legacies.

CIVIL CODE 
556
DETERMINATION OF THE DISPOSABLE PORTION
In order to determine the amount of the portion that the deceased was entitled to dispose of, a mass is formed of all the property that belonged to the deceased at the time of his death, deducting his debts. The assets that were disposed of by way of gift are then fictitiously combined, according to their value determined in accordance with the rules dictated in Articles 747 to 750, and on the estate thus formed the share that the deceased was entitled to dispose of is calculated.

CIVIL CODE 
557
SUBJECTS ENTITLED TO CAILM THE REDUCTION
Reduction of donations and dispositions detrimental to the portion of legitimacy can only be requested by the legitimates and their heirs or successors in title.
They may not waive this right as long as the donor lives, either by express declaration or by assenting to the donation.
Donors and legatees can not ask for reduction or take advantage of it. Neither can the creditors of the deceased ask for it nor take advantage of it, if the legatee entitled to the reduction has accepted with the benefit of inventory.

CIVIL CODE 
558
MODALITIES TO REDUCE TESTAMENTARY DISPOSITIONS
Reduction of testamentary dispositions is done proportionally without distinguishing between heirs and legatees.
If the testator has declared that one of his dispositions is to take effect in preference to the others, this disposition is reduced except to the extent that the value of the others is insufficient to supplement the share reserved for the legitimates.

CIVIL CODE 
559
MODALITIES TO REDUCE DONATIONS

CIVIL CODE
560
REDUCTION OF LEGACY OR DONATION OF REAL PROPERTY
When the object of the legacy or donation to be reduced is real estate, the reduction is made by separating from the real property itself the part needed to supplement the reserved share, if this can be done conveniently.
If the separation cannot be done conveniently and the legatee or donee has in the real property a surplus greater than one-fourth of the available portion, the real property must be left in full in the inheritance, subject to the right to obtain the value of the available portion. If the surplus does not exceed one-fourth, the legatee or donee may retain all of the property, compensating the legitimates in money.
The legatee or donee who is a legitimary may retain all of the property, provided that the value of the property does not exceed the amount of the available portion and the share he is entitled to as a legitimary.

CIVIL CODE
561
RESTITUTION OF REAL PROPERTY
Real property returned as a result of the reduction is free from any burdens or mortgages with which the legatee or donee may have encumbered it, subject to the provisions of No. 8 of article 2652 (i.d., claims for reduction of donations and testamentary dispositions for breach of legitimate proportion must be transcribed and if the transcription is carried out after ten years from the opening of the succession, the judgement granting the application does not affect third parties who have acquired rights for consideration on the basis of a deed trascribed or registered prior to the transcription of the claim). The burdens and mortgages remain effective if the reduction is requested after twenty years from the transcription of the donation, except in this case the obligation of the donee to compensate in money the legitimates by reason of the consequent lower value of the property, provided that the request was made within ten years from the opening of the succession. The same provisions apply to furniture registered in public records. 
The fruits are due from the day of the court application.
 
CIVIL CODE
562
INSOLVENCY OF THE DONEE SUBJECT TO REDUCTION
If the donated property has perished for reasons attributable to the donee or his successors in title, or if the restitution of the donated property cannot be claimed against the purchaser, and the donee is wholly or partially insolvent, the value of the donation that cannot be recovered from the donee is deducted from the estate, but the claims of the legitimated and prior donees against the insolvent donee are not affected
 
CIVIL CODE
563
ACTION AGAINST SUCCESSORS BY DONEES SUBJECT TO REDUCTION
f the donees against whom the reduction has been pronounced have alienated the donated real estate to third parties and twenty years have not elapsed since the transcription of the donation, the legitimary, subject to the execution of the donee's property, may ask the subsequent purchasers, in the manner and order in which it could be asked of the donees themselves, for the restitution of the real property.
The action to obtain restitution must be brought in the order of the date of the alienations, beginning with the last one. Against third-party purchasers the restitution of the movable property, the object of the donation, may also be claimed within the term referred to in subsection 1, subject to the effects of possession in good faith.
The third party purchaser may release itself from the obligation to return the donated property in kind by paying the equivalent in money.
Without prejudice to the provisions of number 8) of ART2652, the lapse of the time limit referred to in the first paragraph and that referred to in the first paragraph of article 561 is suspended with respect to the donor's spouse and relatives in the direct line who have served and transcribed, with respect to the donee and his successors in title, an extrajudicial deed of opposition to the donation. The opposing party's right is personal and renounceable. The opposition loses its effect if it is not renewed before twenty years have elapsed since its transcription.

CIVIL CODE 
564
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE REDUCTION ACTION
A legitimatee who has not accepted the inheritance with the benefit of inventory may not request the reduction of donations and legacies, unless the donations and legacies were made to persons named as co-heirs, even though they have renounced the inheritance. This provision does not apply to the heir who has accepted with the benefit of inventory and who has forfeited it.
In any case, the legitimary, who applies for the reduction of donations or testamentary dispositions, must impute to his or her legitimate portion the donations and legacies made to him or her, unless he or she has been expressly dispensed from them.
A legitimary who succeeds by representation must also impute donations and legacies made, without express dispensation, to his ascendant.
The dispensation has no effect to the detriment of prior donees.

VIOLENCE, MALICE, ERROR
A testamentary disposition might be petitioned by any person interested in it when it is the effect of error, violence, or malice.

CIVIL CODE
625
Erroneous indication of the heir or legatee or of the thing forming the object of the disposition

The disposition takes effect also when the thing forming the subject matter of the disposition has been erroneously indicated or described, but it is certain what thing the testator intended to refer to.

CIVIL CODE
626
ILLICIT MOTIVE

CIVIL CODE
627
TRUST DISPOSITION
No action might be brought in court to establish that dispositions made for the benefit of a person declared in the will are only apparent and actually concern another person, even if expressions in the will might indicate or imply that the person is an interposed person.
However, the person declared in the will, if he or she has voluntarily executed the trust provision by transferring the property to the person intended by the testator, can not sue for repetition unless he or she is an incapacitated person.

CIVIL CODE
631
DISPOSITIONS REMITTED TO THE WILL OF THE THIRD PARTY
Any testamentary provision by which the designation of the heir or legatee, or the determination of the share of the estate, is made to depend on the arbitrariness of a third party is null.
However, a special disposition in favor of a person to be chosen by the honoree or by a third party from among several persons determined by the testator or belonging to families or categories of persons determined by the testator is valid, and a special disposition in favor of one among several entities determined likewise by the testator is also valid. If more than one person is named alternatively and it is not determined who is to make the choice, it is deemed to be left to the honored person.
If the honored person or the third party can not or will not make the choice, it shall be made by decree by the president of the court of the place where the succession was opened, after taking appropriate information.

CONDITIONS OF NOT TO DO OR NOT TO GIVE
If the testator has made a disposition under the condition that the heir or legatee shall not do or give anything for an indefinite period of time, the disposition shall be deemed to have been made under a resolutive condition, unless the will shows a contrary will of the testator.

CIVIL CODE
639
GUARANTEE IN CASE OF RESOLUTIVE CONDITION
If the testamentary disposition is subject to a resolutory condition, the judicial authority, if it deems it advisable, might require the heir or legatee to give suitable security in favor of those to whom the estate or legacy should be devolved in the event that the condition comes true.

CIVIL CODE
640
GUARANTEE IN CASE OF A LEGACY SUBJECT TO A SUSPENDING OR TERMING CONDITION
If a legacy is left to someone under a suspending condition or after a certain time, the honoree might be compelled to give suitable security to the legatee, unless the testator has otherwise provided.

641
ADMINISTRATION IN CASE OF SUSPENDING CONDITION OR OF FAILURE TO GIVE SECURITY
If the heir is established under a suspending condition, until this condition occurs or it is certain that it can no longer occur, an administrator shall be appointed for the inheritance.

CIVIL CODE
642
PERSONS TO WHOM THE ADMINISTRATION PERTAINS
Administration shall be vested in the person in whose favor substitution has been ordered, or in the coheir or coheirs, when there is the right of accretion between them and the conditional heir.

In any case, the judicial authority, when just reasons concur, might provide otherwise.

CIVIL CODE
643
ADMINISTRATION IN CASE OF UNBORN HEIRS
The provisions of the two preceding articles shall also apply in the case where an unconceived child of a specified living person is called to succeed.

CIVIL CODE
647
BURDEN
Both to the institution of an heir and to a legacy a charge might be affixed.
Unless the testator has otherwise provided, the judicial authority, if it deems it advisable, might impose a security on the burdened heir or legatee.
An impossible or unlawful charge shall be deemed not to have been affixed; it shall, however, render the disposition null if it constituted its sole determining reason.

CIVIL CODE
648
PERFORMANCE OF THE BURDEN
For the fulfillment of the burden any interested party might act.
In the case of non-fulfillment of the charge, the judicial authority might pronounce the termination of the testamentary disposition, if the termination was intended by the testator, or if the fulfillment of the charge constituted the sole determining reason for the disposition.

CIVIL CODE
649
ACQUISITION OF LEGACIES
A legacy is acquired without the need for acceptance, without prejudice to the right to renounce it.
When the object of the legacy is the ownership of a certain thing or other right belonging to the testator, the ownership or right shall be transmitted from the testator to the legatee at the time of the testator's death.
The legatee, however, must apply to the legatee for possession of the thing legated, even when he/she has been expressly dispensed from it by the testator.
 
CIVIL CODE
650
ESTABLISHMENT OF A TIME LIMIT FOR RELINQUISHMENT

CIVIL CODE
651
LEGATE OF THING OF THE LEGATEE OR OF A THIRD PARTY
A legacy of the thing of the honored person or of a third party is null, unless it appears from the will or other statement in writing by the testator that he knew that the thing legated belonged to the honored person or to the third party. In the latter case, the honoree is obliged to acquire ownership of the thing from the third party and to transfer it to the legatee, but it is within his power to pay the legatee a fair price for it.

CIVIL CODE
652
LEGATE OF THING BELONGING ONLY IN PART TO THE TESTATOR

LEGACY OF THING NOT EXISTING IN THE ESTATE
When the testator has left a particular thing of his or her own, or a thing determined only in kind to be taken from his or her estate, the legacy has no effect if the thing is not in the testator's estate at the time of his or her death.
If the thing is in the testator's estate at the time of his death, but not in the quantity determined, the legacy takes effect for the quantity found therein.

CIVIL CODE
655
LEGACY OF THING TO BE TAKEN FROM CERTAIN PLACE
The legacy of things to be taken from certain place takes effect only if the things are found there, and for the part that is found there; it takes effect, however, for the whole when, at the death of the testator, the things are not found there, in whole or in part, because they had been temporarily removed from the place where they were usually kept.

CIVIL CODE
656
LEGACY OF THING OF THE LEGATEE
A legatee of a thing which at the time when the will was made was already the property of the legatee shall be void, if the thing is in his property even at the time of the opening of the succession.
If at the time of the opening of the succession the thing is in the property of the testator, the legacy is valid, and it is also valid if at this time the thing is in the property of the honored person or of a third party, and it appears from the will that it was legated in view of this event.

CIVIL CODE
657
LEGATE OF THING ACQUIRED BY THE LEGATEE
If the legatee, after the making of the will, has acquired from the testator, either for consideration or free of charge, the thing legated to him, the legacy is without effect in accordance with ART686.
If after the making of the will the thing legated has been purchased by the legatee, free of charge, from the honoree or a third party, the legatee is without effect; if the purchase took place with charge, the legatee is entitled to reimbursement of the price, if the circumstances indicated in ART651 (Legate of thing of the legatee or of a third party - A legacy of the thing of the honored person or of a third party is null, unless it appears from the will or other statement in writing by the testator that he knew that the thing legated belonged to the honored person or to the third party. In the latter case, the honoree is obliged to acquire ownership of the thing from the third party and to transfer it to the legatee, but it is within his power to pay the legatee a fair price for it.

On each of the several legatees the legacy shall be borne in proportion to their respective share in the estate or legacy, if the testator has not otherwise provided.

CIVIL CODE
663
LEGACIES IMPOSED ON ONLY ONE HEIR
If the obligation to fulfill the legacy has been particularly imposed on one of the heirs, that heir alone is obliged to fulfill it.

CIVIL CODE
ARTICLE 664
FULFILLMENT OF THE LEGACY OF KIND
In the legacy of a thing determined only in kind, the choice, when not entrusted by the testator to the legatee or to a third party, rests with the honoree. The latter is obliged to give things of no less than average quality; but if there is only one of the things belonging to the genus specified in the estate, the honoree has no right nor can he be obliged to lend another, unless the testator expressly provides otherwise.
If the choice is left by the testator to the legatee or a third party, they must choose a thing of average quality; but if things of the kind indicated are found in the estate, the legatee might choose the best.
If the third party can not or will not make the choice, it shall be made in accordance with the third paragraph of ART631 (If the honored person or the third party can not or will not make the choice, it shall be made by decree by the president of the court of the place where the succession was opened, after taking appropriate information.).

CIVIL CODE
665

CIVIL CODE
667
ACCESSIONS OF THE THING LEGATED
The thing legated, with all its appurtenances, shall be lent to the legatee in the state in which it is at the time of the testator's death.
If a fund has been bequeathed, the constructions made in the fund are also included in the legacy, whether they already existed at the time of the making of the will or not, subject in any case to the applicability of the second paragraph of ART686 (The same is the case if the testator has transformed the thing legated into another, so that the one has lost its former form and primitive name.).
If the bequeathed estate has been increased by subsequent purchases, these are due to the legatee, provided that they are contiguous to the estate and form an economic unit with it.

CIVIL CODE
668
FULFILLMENT OF LEGACY
If the thing legated is encumbered by an easement, a fee or other charge inherent in the estate, or by a land annuity, the burden thereof shall be borne by the legatee.
If the thing legated is legated for a simple annuity, fee or other debt of the estate, or even of a third party, the heir shall be liable to pay the annuities or interest and the principal sum, according to the nature of the debt, if the testator has not otherwise provided.

CIVIL CODE
669
FRUITS OF THE THING BEQUEATHED
If the object of the legacy is an interest-bearing thing belonging to the testator at the time of his death, the fruits or interest are due to the legatee from this time.
If the thing belongs to the legatee or to a third party, or if it is a thing determined by kind or quantity, the fruits or interest are due from the day of the legal demand or from the day on which the performance of the legacy was promised, unless the testator has provided otherwise.

CIVIL CODE
670
LEGACY OF PERIODIC PERFORMANCE
If a sum of money or a quantity of other fungible things has been bequeathed, to be rendered on periodic terms, the first term shall run from the death of the testator, and the legatee acquires the right to all the performance due for the current term, even though he was alive only at the beginning of it. The legacy, however, cannot be demanded until after the term has expired.
However, a legacy by way of alimony might be demanded at the beginning of the term.

CIVIL CODE

CIVIL CODE
674
ACCRETION AMONG CO-HEIRS
When several heirs have been established by the same will in the universality of property, without determination of parts or in equal parts, even if determined, if one of them is unable or unwilling to accept his share he shall accrue to the others.
If several heirs have been established in the same share, the accretion shall take place in favor of the others established in the same share.
Accretion does not take place when the will shows a different will of the testator.
In any case, the right of representation shall be excepted.

CIVIL CODE
675
ACCRETION BETWEEN LEGATEES
Accretion shall also take place among several legatees to whom the same object has been bequeathed, unless a different will results from the will and subject always to the right of representation.

CIVIL CODE
676
EFFECTS OF ACCRETION

LACK OF ACCRETION
If no accretion takes place, the portion of the missing heir shall devolve to the legitimate heirs, and the portion of the missing legatee shall go to the benefit of the honoree.
The legitimate heirs and the honored person shall succeed to the obligations that were incumbent on the missing heir or legatee, except in the case of obligations of a personal nature.

678
ACCRETION IN THE LEGACY OF USUFRUCT
When a usufruct is bequeathed to several persons so that there is a right of accretion among them, the accretion shall take place even when one of them passes away after having achieved possession of the thing on which the usufruct falls.
If there is no right of accretion, the missing legatee's portion shall be consolidated with the property.

CIVIL CODE
684
DESTRUCTION OF THE HOLOGRAPHIC WILL
A holographic will that has been destroyed, torn or erased, in whole or in part, shall be deemed to have been revoked in whole or in part, unless it is proved that it was destroyed, torn or erased by a person other than the testator, or it is proved that the testator had no intention to revoke it.

CIVIL CODE
685
EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWAL OF SECRET WILL
The withdrawal of the secret will, by the testator, from the hands of the notary or archivist with whom it is deposited, shall not import revocation of the will when the testamentary record might count as a holographic will.

CIVIL CODE
686
ALIENATION AND TRANSFORMATION OF THE THING LEGATED
The alienation that the testator makes of the thing legated or part of it, including by sale with redemption agreement, revokes the legacy with respect to what has been alienated, even when the alienation is voidable for causes other than defects of consent, or the thing returns to the testator's property.
The same is the case if the testator has transformed the thing legated into another, so that the one has lost its former form and primitive name.
Evidence of a different will of the testator is admitted.

CIVIL CODE
687
REVOCATION DUE TO SUPERVENING CHILDREN
Dispositions by universal or particular title, made by one who at the time of the will did not have or was unaware of having children or descendants, shall be revoked as of right by reason of the existence or supervening of a child or descendant of the testator, even if posthumous, including adoptive, or by reason of the recognition of a child born out of wedlock. 
Revocation takes place even if the child was conceived at the time of the will.
On the other hand, revocation does not take place if the testator has made provision for the case that children or descendants of children existed or survived.
If children or descendants do not come to the succession and no representation is made, the disposition has its effect.

CIVIL CODE
688
CASES OF ORDINARY SUBSTITUTION

The same provision shall apply in the case of a minor, if he or she is in the condition of habitual insanity such as to presume that within the period specified in ART416 the pronouncement of disqualification will intervene.
In the case of a plurality of persons or entities referred to in the first paragraph, the property shall be attributed in proportion to the time during which the same persons or entities took care of the disqualified person.
Substitution shall be without effect in the event that the interdiction is denied or the related proceedings are not commenced within two years after the habitually insane minor reaches the age of majority. It is also without effect in the case of revocation of the disqualification or with respect to persons or entities that have violated the obligations of care.
In any other case the substitution is void.
